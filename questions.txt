1. What's the difference between those two?
    a. beforeEach((() => {})
    b. beforeEach(async(() => {})

2. How to test lifecycle hook methods (i.e. in the CoursesListComponent)?

3. How to debug unit test (and not only unit tests)?

4. What's the advantage of using Object.assign(..) in the constructor?

  constructor(properties: any) {
    Object.assign(this, properties); // Copies all values from properties to this
  }
